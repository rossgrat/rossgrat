My name is Ross and I am a Software and Embedded Systems Engineer based in West Michigan.

I am currently employed at a [small startup](https://reflexion.co) where I wear many hats and have worked on everything from Embedded Linux programs interfacing with custom hardware to a monolithic Golang web server running VR app and Typescript web client.

I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2022 with dual degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Check out a list of courses I have completed [here](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/courses/eecs/).
