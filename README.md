Hello! My name is Ross and I am a Software and Embedded Systems Engineer based in Chicago.

I am currently working on backends at [Fetch](https://fetch.com/). Previously I was employed at a [small startup](https://reflexion.co) where I cut my teeth on backend development, web-based frontend devlopment, and embedded systems design.

I received dual undergraduate degrees from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 2022 in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
